[Em] Another [C] head hangs lowly \

[Em] And the violence [C] caused such silence \
[G]  Who are we [D] mistaken?

[Em] But you see, it's not me, it's not [C] my family \
[G]  In your head, in your head they are [D] fightin' \
[Em] With their tanks and their bombs [C] and their bombs and their guns \
[G]  In your head, in your head they are [D] cryin'
